# Pi-Trader

This project involves the development of a predictive stock market analysis system using machine learning techniques. The application is built with Python Flask and leverages various libraries such as Keras and scikit-learn.

## Features
**Real-Time Stock Prediction:** Utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for predicting stock prices in real-time.

**Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Integrates a REST API to collect and preprocess historical stock market data for training.

**Machine Learning Models:** Trained and evaluated models for accuracy and performance, ensuring reliable predictions.

**Deployment:** The entire predictive system is deployed on a Python Flask web application for accessible and interactive use.

## Technologies Used
**Framework:** Python Flask

**Machine Learning:** Keras, scikit-learn

**Data Handling:** REST API integration for data collection and preprocessing

**Algorithm:** LSTM networks for time-series analysis
